# Master Stability Function Analysis

This repository contains Python code and plots for computing Master Stability Functions (MSFs) for three nonlinear dynamical systems:

- Lorenz system
- Forced Duffing oscillator  
- Forced Van der Pol oscillator

## Folder Structure
- `Lorenz/`: Jupyter notebooks and plots for all 9 coupling configurations
- `Duffing/`: Notebooks and plots for 4 coupling configurations  
- `van_der_Pol/`: Notebooks and plots for 4 coupling configurations

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
Run any Jupyter notebook to reproduce the MSF calculations for a specific system and coupling configuration.

## Reference
This work is part of the paper "Master Stability Function: A formalism that separates dynamics from structure" submitted to Revista Brasileira de Ensino de Física.
